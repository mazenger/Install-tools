+ Access Grafana Web Interface:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the IP address of your machine if running remotely).

+ Integrate Grafana with Prometheus:

In the Grafana web interface, click on the "Configuration" icon (cogwheel) in the sidebar and select "Data Sources".
Click "Add data source" and choose "Prometheus" as the type.
Enter a name for the data source (e.g., "Prometheus").
In the "URL" field, enter the URL of your Prometheus server. The default URL is http://localhost:9090 if you followed the previous instructions.
Click "Save & Test" to save the configuration and test the connection. If successful, you should see a message indicating a successful connection.

+ Create a Grafana Dashboard:

Click the "+" icon in the top navigation bar and select "Dashboard".
Give your dashboard a name and click "Create".
You can now add panels to your dashboard to visualize Prometheus metrics.
In the panel edit view, select your Prometheus data source and enter the desired PromQL query to fetch the metrics you want to visualize.

Remember:

You might need to adjust the URLs and paths depending on your specific setup (e.g., if you installed Prometheus in a non-default location).
Explore the Grafana documentation for detailed information on creating dashboards and using PromQL for querying metrics.

Importing Grafana Dashboard by URL or ID:

Within Grafana, navigate to the "Home" or "Dashboards" page.

Click the "New" button and select "Import".

You'll see three options:

Upload a JSON file: This is for importing dashboards you've downloaded as JSON files.
From Grafana.com: If the dashboard is publicly available on Grafana.com, you can enter its URL or ID here.
Enter dashboard JSON: You can paste the raw JSON code of the dashboard directly into this field.
Choose the "From Grafana.com" option.

In the field provided, paste the URL of the dashboard you want to import. Alternatively, if you know the dashboard ID on Grafana.com, you can enter that instead of the URL.
